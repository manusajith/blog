The need of Virtual Credit Card (VCC) has really gone high with the introduction of new PayPal rules in India and other countries. First of all VCC is not only for PayPal; it is useful for all kinds of online shopping. Once you have created a VCC it can be used anywhere just like an ordinary Credit Card. In this post I have specifically dealt with its usage regarding PayPal verification. There are few good sites that can be used for creating VCC and I will explain this tutorial with my favorite site  EntroPay.

<strong>Creating Virtual Credit Card (VCC)</strong>

1. First you have to go to <a href="http://www.entropay.com/" target="_blank">EntroPay.com</a>.

2. Register for an EntroPay account by using the signup now button available right side.

3. On clicking that you will be shown a screen highlighting some features with a button at bottom showing Get Your Virtual Visa Now!, just press that (Or) there might be an option saying Open an EntroPay account.

4. Once you have entered all the basic details in the next step you have to enter the funding sources. In my case I used my Debit Card provided by Indian Overseas Bank. You can use your Debit Card (or Credit Card) as funding source. It can be a Debit Card or Credit Card but you must be able to deposit a minimum a $20 from the Card.

5. Next after the Card activation step you have to Load the Card. You can specify the amount you want to load. I entered the minimum amount of $20. This amount is just going to be there in your EntroPay Card which you can use it later for online purchases.

6. At the end of registration you will see your Card which looks similar to all other Credit Cards.

By completing these steps Virtual Credit Card is ready.

<strong>Verifying PayPal account using VCC</strong>

1. First you have to Login to your PayPal account and choose Add/Edit Credit Card option under Profile menu at top.

2. Next you have to enter the details as it appears on your EntroPay Card and submit. Your Card will be charged 1.50 EUR and this amount will be credited back to your PayPal account once you have verified the Card. So no worries.

3. After 2-3 days in your EntroPay Card Statement you will see a PayPal transaction with a 4 digit code.

4. Next you have to go to your PayPal account and choose Add/Edit Credit Card option under Profile menu at top. There you will see your Card with a link saying Enter PayPal code. You have to click on that and enter the 4 digit code, and then confirm.

Once you have verified, the small amount that was charged will be credited back to your account.

Thats it. By this PayPal verification is over.

Not only for PayPal you can use it for all online transactions. I used my EntroPay Card forbuying few domains and the process went smoothly just like all other Cards.
