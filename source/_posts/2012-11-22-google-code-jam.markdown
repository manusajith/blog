<a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/" title="Code Jam" target="_blank">Google Code Jam </a> is an international programming competition hosted and administered by <a href="http://google.com" title="Google" target="_blank">Google</a>. The competition began in 2003 as a means to identify top engineering talent for potential employment at Google. The competition consists of a set of algorithmic problems which must be solved in a fixed amount of time. Competitors may use any programming language and development environment to obtain their solutions.

In 2013, Google Code Jam will mark its tenth year of bringing the world's coding community together to solve tough algorithmic puzzles.
