My name is Manu S Ajith, also known under the alias “Neo”.

I‘m 22 years old, living in the “Venice of the East” from the very own “Gods own country”, Kerala and working as a freelancer with the goal to make the web a better place!

I neva count hours I spend on working here, bcoz I actually neva work here
I learn, enjoy process n evolve my own skills all the time.
I cannot really tell my profession since I know everything a bit  as a programmer, as designer, as freelancer  basically I know everything and I don't know nothing.I am working for higher goal, future vision in mind.
I am enjoying every second here  passion does its magic here, 

I started coding 3 yrs ago with languages like php, python and java.
Gradually I developed my interest in javascript development, AJAX, Flash and Action scripts.

Recently I found my focus in the field of server administration and shell scripting which gave me a new area of
interest – Ethical Hacking (  ).

My thanks goes to all my loyal readers, who respects my work and keep coming back! Cheers to you guys!
