Did you know that <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> offers 2-step login verification for Gmail accounts? The feature has been around a while, and now Google has written a reminder for all users who need an extra layer of security for their Gmail account and other services connected to it.

<strong>How Does the 2-step Verification System Work?</strong>

The 2-step verification introduces a second layer of protection by using a one-time verification code that is sent to you <a title="How to Set Up and Use Facebook Via Mobile SMS" href="http://www.guidingtech.com/8635/use-facebook-via-mobile-sms/">via a text message</a> or a <a title="How to Get Started with Google Voice on Desktop and Mobile" href="http://www.guidingtech.com/6170/how-to-get-started-with-google-voice-on-desktop-and-mobile/">voice message</a> to your mobile device. Google will ask for this code if it senses that you have logged in from a new browser or a new device, other than your default ones. You have to key in this code after the password to authenticate your Google account. Sending an authentication code to your mobile makes it almost impossible for hackers to break into your account. Of course, you must have a mobile that supports SMS or voice messages from Google.

Here is a more detailed walkthrough which explains how to set it up for Gmail and Google accounts:

Sign-in to your Google account and go to the <a title="2-step verification page" href="https://accounts.google.com/b/0/SmsAuthConfig" target="_blank">2-step verification page</a>. You can use the direct link or reach it via your Google account settings.

Click on the large <strong>blue Setup button </strong>and the guide walks you through the steps needed to setup the authentication layer. Basically it involves giving Google your mobile number and choosing the mode of code delivery (text or voice).

You don't want to enter a code again and again for checking your email, so setup Google to remember your trusted devices for at least 30 days.

In the final step, activate 2-step verification for your Google account. Now, if you sign-in from an unrecognized device or computer, you will be asked for the code.

Google also prompts you to create some application specific passwords. Its for those apps you use to access your Google accounts from mobile devices and <a title="How to Set Up Gmail in Thunderbird" href="http://www.guidingtech.com/2219/set-up-gmail-in-thunderbird/">third-party email clients</a> like <a title="How to Sync Google Calendar with Microsoft Outlook" href="http://www.guidingtech.com/8710/sync-google-calendar-with-outlook/">MS Outlook</a>.

You can also add a trusted secondary mobile number to receive the verification codes, in case you lose your main phone or keep it somewhere else. Google also gives you backup codes to access your email accounts on the go when you might not have cell coverage. These <em>permanent </em>codes do not expire and you can use them during such emergencies.
